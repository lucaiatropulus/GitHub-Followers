# GitHub Followers

GitHub Followers is a project developed during the "iOS Dev Job Interview Practice - Take Home Project" by Sean Allen and allows you to look up the followers of any GitHub user, see details about each follower and look up their followers as well. You can also save your favorite users to a favorites list that persists locally via UserDefaults.

The project uses Swift, UIKit and the MVC pattern, features a fully programmatic UI, multiple Network Calls, Image Caching, List Pagination and Data Persistence via UserDefaults.
